          <img src="images/mm-red.jpg" alt="This is a logo I designed for my idea of a Japanese style convenience store." id="mm-red">
          <p id="proj_description">I am a big fan of Japanese culture and always wanted to have a Japanese style convenience store in the US. After browsing through the internet, talking to friends and family, I came to the conclusion that others feel the same way. Unlike convenience stores in the US, Japanese ones provide freshly made ready to-go food, quality goods (such as everyday essentials), and quirky Japanese pop culture merchandise. I created this logo as a prototype of the store's logo.</p>
